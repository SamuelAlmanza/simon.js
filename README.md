<h2>Based on the classic Simon game</h2>

<h3>Rules:</h3> 

The game generates one random color per level and adds it to an array. 

The game will only show you the last color in the array so the challenge comes from memorizing the game's pattern.

The game checks each of your button presses against its stored values. 

If you get the entire pattern correct, you move on to the next level. 
If any button presses are incorrect, the game is over and you are prompted to restart.

Have fun!
